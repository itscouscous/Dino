# Dino: Dine out without Worries

A rudimentary, database-driven review website for restaurants in the Madison, WI area, focused on spatial and dietary accessibility. Database storage and deployment using Firebase. Created by [June Kim](mailto:dkim598@wisc.edu) and [Megan Winarta](mvwinarta@wisc.edu) for INFO SYS 371 at UW Madison (Fall 2021). 

## Problem Statement

If you’re someone who has certain allergies, disabilities, or diet restrictions, you've probably had trouble finding a restaurant that is ready and willing to meet your needs. Often, we don’t discover a restaurant’s lack of dining accommodations until we’ve arrived at the place or scrolled through their lengthy online menus. While other sites review and sort restaurants by cuisine and price point, many have yet to specifically address these needs.

[Dino](https://is371-dino.web.app/) aims to provide people with information to help them find restaurants that meet their needs, especially for our friends in often under-represented communities.

## Notes

With the limited time frame to create this site, we had to sacrifice some functionalities in favor of others and ensure that we hand in a fully functional website by the deadline. Nevertheless, we hope these features could be implemented in the future.

This project proved to be a challenge, particularly with the data-collection process. We originally intended to include a data set of menu items and their classifications, as well as information about the restaurant space that might pose accessibility issues.  Ideally, our restaurant data set should also be updated in real time. The homepage should also have a personalized list of restaurant recommendations. There should also be a profile page where users can edit their preferences. Lastly, there should be a secondary user type ie. admins to regulate the reviews.
